# Naga_KeypadMapper
This little linux xorg daemon allows you to map the side keypad of the Razer Naga series mice via a configuration file called mapping.txt under $HOME/.naga/

The configuration file mapping.txt has the following syntax:

<keynumber> - <option>=<action>

<keynumber> is a number between 1-14 representing the 12 keys of the naga's keypad + two on the top of the naga.

<option> is either key (for remapping keys) or run (for running a system command, or a custom script through an alias i.e.)

<action> 
  For key: is the custom key mapping, might be a single key like A or a combination like ctrl+t (following xdotool's syntax)
  For run: a system command like top or a custom script like bash /usr/local/bin/custom.bash
  

if the mapping_01.txt file is missing the default mapping_01.txt corresponds to the numbers 0-11 assigned to the buttons: (the program will NOT autocreate this file, the install.sh script will though)

An example mapping_01.txt configuration file is the following:
--------------------------
#There must be no blank lines at the beggining of the file, yeah lazy parsing. Comments are accepted though
1 - key=ctrl+t
2 - key=A
3 - key=B
4 - key=C
5 - key=D
6 - key=E
7 - key=F
8 - key=G
9 - key=alt+F4
10 - run=gedit
11 - key=H
12 - key=I
13 - key=ctrl+Tab
14 - chmap=mapping_02.txt
------------------------------
(Do not include the ---- in the actual file) 

CAUTION, in this first alpha version the run option wont work for text enviroment commands, like for example top.
As an alpha version, it is very prone to bugs and other sorts of faliure, use under your own responsability.


Be adviced that I release this project without any sort of warranty. So use under your own responsability.

This daemon does not, in any case modify any system file nor propertie of any device. So the process is totally reversible just by deleting the files and rebooting the computer.


#INSTALLATION

It does not need any dependencies besides having installed xdotool http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool/  (in the oficial ubuntu repositories)
and g++

Just run install.sh as sudo.
This will compile the source and copy the necesary files (see install.sh for more info)

#USAGE
The instalation process automatically executes the daemon in the background and set it to start at boot for you. But you can still run it manually as follows:

nagastart.sh does the below process automatically:

1) naga executable has to be called as sudo or have the s bit up with chmod u+s at least.
- I dont know how to overcome the need for sudo privileges, if you know let me know please!

2) Init the mapper by calling: $./naga epic or $./naga 2014

3) In order to get rid of the original bindings you have to disable the keypad using xinput as follows:

$ xinput set-int-prop [id] "Device Enabled" 8 0

where [id] is the id number of the keypad returned by $ xinput.

4) You have to also run 

$ xinput set-button-map [id2] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 11 10 8 9 13 14 15

where [id2] is the id number of the pointer device returned by $ xinput - in case of naga 2014 you also have to check which of those two has more than 7 numbers by typing $ xinput get-button-map [id2]

This lasts until the x server is restarted (nagastart.sh is aware of this), but you can enable it back to completly restore the changes by changing the last 0 to a 1.

#UNINSTALATION

You just have to delete the files created:

$sudo rm /usr/local/bin/naga ~/.config/autostart/naga.desktop /usr/local/bin/nagastart.sh
$sudo rm -r ~/.naga
